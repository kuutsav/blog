# Utsav's Blog

Hi, I'm Utsav. This is my blog about various programming related topics. I'm especially interested in training and inference of LLMs on cosumer grade hardware.

## Feedback

If you see a typo or want to make a comment on something, submit a pull request.  You might even be able to do it from GitHub itself (press '.' to bring up an editor while viewing the repository).
I have also activated discussions for the repo so that can also be a place for conversation.
